## Draft Outreach
Hi [Name], saw CJ just joined as CEO - congrats on the leadership transition. Given MongoDB's 1.5M+ developer community and Atlas's 66% revenue share, I think there's a strong opportunity to amplify your developer acquisition through TLDR's 4M+ technical subscribers. We helped a major database company generate $340K pipeline with a 2.8% CTR targeting the exact engineers building on platforms like MongoDB.
